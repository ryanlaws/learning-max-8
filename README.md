# Welcome
I am learning Max 8. This [Wiki](https://github.com/ryanlaws/learning-max-8/wiki) is for my benefit, but if you are also learning Max I hope you find it useful.

# Disclaimer
I offer no guarantees of any kind. I have no affiliation with Cycling 74 or Ableton. I'm just someone trying to learn Max in a way that works for me. 

# Feedback
Thanks for your interest. Please create, or comment on, an [Issue](https://github.com/ryanlaws/learning-max-8/issues).
